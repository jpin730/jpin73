# Personal GitHub Page

This page is my portfolio. Made with Vite + React + Bootstrap.

## How to use

Install nvm and run `nvm use` to use the correct node version.

Install dependencies using `npm install`.

Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

For building the project, run `npm run build`.

Deployments are done on push to the `main` branch using GitHub Pages.
